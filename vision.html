      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>Youth needs the right type of guidance when it comes to making them realize and work for their dreams and only people with experience can give that sense of direction. We are hoping we can make a huge difference in their lives by offering the right guidance towards achieving their goals. Everyone wants the best they can get, and we intend to give it to them. We do not want to leave any doubt in the minds of the youth coming to our football academy so, we will do anything and everything to make sure each child gets the right amount of attention and no one is left alone in their journey of fulfilling their dreams.</p>
      <h1>Vision</h1>
      <p>A lot of people tell the youth to focus on studies and never on things that make that person happy. We want to change that. We do not want the children to realize too late that they could have worked on honing their passion instead of focusing on studies which they never had a knack for. We want our participants to strive for greatness. They deserve nothing but the best when it comes to their future and we will provide that with top-of-the-class coaches and instructors at their disposal. Their future is not something anyone should take lightly, and we will not make that mistake. We will guide the youth to the best of our abilities and make sure they have all the tools they require to fulfill their dreams in the sport of football.</p>
